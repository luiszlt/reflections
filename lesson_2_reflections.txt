When you initialize a repository a .git directory is created.

The directory is needed so that you can start tracking the file history in the folder where you created a directory.

The staging area offers a place to add files without committing so that you can change your mind afterwards. The working directory 
is the directory that houses all files whether they are being tracked or not. The staging area is probably just pointers in memory to the files.
